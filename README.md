RELAXATION TIME FOR A PARAMETRIC FAMILY OF ZERO-RANGE PROCESSES

In this repository you will find the code used to generate the data and plots with which we support the conclusions of the article 
"RELAXATION TIME FOR A PARAMETRIC FAMILY OF ZERO-RANGE PROCESSES" (available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/***)

We numerically compute the relaxation time Wα(n, k) for the zero-range processes with
rate function given by gα for n = 3 sites and the number of particles k varying from
1 to 50 for some values of α ∈ [0, ∞). After that, we compare this values with the
functions n2(1 + kn )α∧2 proposed in the conjecture.
